# Description

In this first scenario, you'll take the role of Jane, a developer who needs to deploy a new Key-Value Store for an application she's working with. After discussions, it's been decided to use Redis, a popular KV Store.

Jane is unfamiliar with how Redis is deployed but has heard Docker makes it straightforward to deploy services into development and production.

This scenario discusses how she will complete her task and deploy Redis as a Docker Container.

Jane's development environment has access to latest version of the Docker Engine via a machine called docker. Her local dev machine has the Docker Client installed and accessible via the command line.
